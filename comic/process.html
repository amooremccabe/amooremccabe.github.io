In the later months of 2022, I began making plans to make a comic about my physical education class. Around a month later, I stopped doing that.
<br><br>I had a dream about a king ruling over an empty desert, and something about the imagery stuck with me.

I made a lot more pages in a more fancy way, which took a long time. Now there's a <a href="comic.html">comic</a>. The highlights of the process were:
<ul>
  <li class="blue3">using the computer was hard<br><br>
  <li class="blue3">drawing was more fun but took forever and about half of the comic was completed in Spanish class<br><br>
  <li class="blue3">the matter of whether I am worse at storytelling or time management is still unsettled<br><br>
  <li class="blue3">preparing the comic for printing was a bit like falling down a stairwell except slower and less fun<br><br>
  </ul>
