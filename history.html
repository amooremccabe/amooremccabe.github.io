<h3 class="green2">I. Introduction</h3><p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
	  Perhaps the greatest advantage of the form of comics is that it makes stories interesting to look at. The art of storytelling is difficult, but its objective can be described simply as keeping readers reading. Many stories have already been told in one form or another, and authors must often change the way in which they tell the stories instead of the stories themselves. (This is not to imply that the stories themselves do not have significant differences from one another. At least in my experience, though, the way in which the story is told is what gets remembered.) Adding pictures to the stories offers a wealth of new methods of storytelling. Many successful works of comics follow this form. In <i>Maus</i>, Art Spiegelman told his father’s story of the Holocaust, while illustrating characters as mice. In <i>Building Stories</i>, Chris Ware told stories of loneliness from the figurative and literal point of view of a building. This paper will examine the history of the form of comics as its techniques of visual storytelling became increasingly sophisticated, describe contemporary examples of the medium, and consider works that analyze the medium of comics or offer instructions for success in it in order to inform my own approach to visual storytelling.

<h3 class="green2">II. History</h3><p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  My source of information for the early history of comics is <i>The Origins of Comics</i>, by Thierry Smolderen. It traces the history of sequential art from the early 1700s to the early 1900s, at which point the comics being published began to bear some resemblance to those that are published today. In summary:
</p>
<p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  While sequential art has existed approximately as long as humans have been making art, Smolderen begins to trace the history of modern comics with the work of William Hogarth. Raised in a debtor’s prison, Hogarth came to resent rules and regulation in any form. While he admired the artistic style of the Baroque movement, he resented the way in which it was taught. He abandoned the traditional method of copying the works of earlier painters, and instead walked the streets of London, looking for scenes and figures that he could illustrate later from memory. Later in his career, Hogarth became interested in telling stories. Inspired by Venetian picture stories, which traditionally told the stories of mythological or religious heroes, Hogarth made collections of engravings depicting the stories of less respected members of society: A Harlot’s Progress was published in 1732, A Rake’s Progress in 1735. These works, for their era, were unusually sympathetic to the characters they represented. For example, the first plate of A Harlot’s Progress (Fig. 1), references The Choice of Hercules, a common allegorical motif at the time. In the myth, Hercules was confronted by personifications of Virtue and Vice. In the first panel of A Harlot’s Progress, the religious man (a personification of Virtue) has already turned his back on the woman who is the central character of the story. As put by Smolderen, “if Virtue doesn’t even speak to her, what chance does she have to take the proper path?” (Smolderen 22). These examples of sequential art are important to the history of comics in two ways. First, they represented the chaos of life on the streets with Baroque realism, an early instance of the comic art tradition of using either a style of art that contrasts with the content being represented or multiple contrasting styles of art in one image. Second, it brought some of the complexity of the written word to a visual context; the engravings required deliberate detective work for the meanings of the stories to emerge.

  Hogarth’s later work also played an important role in the development of comics; it dealt with caricature and methods of rendering the figure. In <i>The Analysis of Beauty</i>, Hogarth posited that what was intricate and varied was beautiful, and what was simple and geometric was comical. He extended his definition of the comical to include any imitation of a previous work. The classical positions that were the traditional postures of statues and figures paintings were being so overused and so clumsily imitated (without intricacy or variety) that they simply looked funny. Observing that it would be difficult to have <i>realistic</i> comic scenes in which every character was imitating the classical poses of the high arts, Hogarth decided that figures suspended in the middle of an action, such as dancing, were also comical. (Caught unawares, these figures would be unable to deliberately appear intricate and varied.) Hogarth’s division of the beautiful and the comical proved useful a century later, for Rodolphe Töpffer.

  </p>
<p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  Töpffer shared Hogarth’s dislike of the traditional and regulated. And in the historical context of the early 1800s, he found multiple other inspirations: the romantic-era fascination with primitive ways of drawing, which he shared, and the Industrial Revolution, which he disliked. Töpffer believed that caricatures, doodles, and stick figures captured life better than any realistic rendering could. His dislike of the Industrial Revolution was visible immediately in the stories he wrote (see Fig. 2, from a story about how a dog “lightly” stepping on the arm of a telegraph machine plunges Europe into chaos), but also in his choices of artistic style.
  </p>

<p class=" blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  The first of Töpffer’s unusual artistic choices: every action by any character is accompanied by an exaggerated theatrical gesture. In the early 1800s, this was becoming the standard for plays. Playwrights, no longer convinced that every aspect of a story could be conveyed with dialogue, included gestures corresponding to the dialogue in their scripts. Encyclopedias of gestures were published that codified the translation of dialogue to theatrical motions. While Töpffer recognized the utility of the visual interest brought by these gestures, he resented codification. Seeing the translated gestures as a simplistic and mechanical way of increasing popular consumption, reminiscent of the processes of the Industrial Revolution, he satirized it in his comics. The second of Töpffer’s unusual choices: he represented his stories in strips of illustrations. From the perspective of the 21st century, with multiple centuries of comic strips behind us, this choice doesn’t seem strange. It was not an established technique in the early 19th century, though; Töpffer thought it, too, was reminiscent of the mechanical simplicity of the Industrial Revolution, and intended it as irony. The public, however, did not perceive Töpffer’s simultaneous sequential satire of sequence, pantomimed satire of pantomime, and diatribe against the Industrial Revolution as the author had intended. For the most part, they thought it was funny.
  </p>
  <p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    As newspapers and periodicals became the primary outlet for sequential art and comics, several things changed. Developments in comics became dictated by the interests of newspaper audiences. These readers were more interested in the novelty of the visual form of storytelling than in the stories themselves; artists focused on telling old stories with interesting new forms of art: caricature, imitation of enlightened manuscripts captioned in fake “Olde Englyshe” (Fig. 3), woodcut noir realism, etc. Some artists, not satisfied with simply telling the old stories in new ways, clung desperately to a sense of ironic self-awareness. The developing romantic interest in the primitive and old fashioned led to comics that look less like modern comics than Töpffer’s did. These changes can be tracked across two different genres of comics. The first of these genres was the journalistic picture story. In this form, journals such as <i>The Graphic</i> adapted anecdotes sketched by readers and journalists into professional picture stories. The anecdotes reflected daily life across the British Empire; spectacular narratives were not published. Artists were primarily concerned with how they could bring varying styles of illustration to the anecdotes, but also often included self-aware depictions of the struggles of illustration in the field, if only for the interest they added to bland stories. The second genre that went through these changes was the humoristic picture story. Though they were more concerned with people than the journalistic variety, these stories were not varied; they were unoriginal retellings of English middle-class traditions and the predictable dramas that went along with them. (For example, disagreements at Christmas dinners.) This predictability was a feature of the comics that was later recognized by early 20th century psychologists as crucial in forming a newspaper buying habit in customers. The varying styles of illustration were generally used not for purely visual artistic experimentation but for comic effect.

  <p class="blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    An interesting trend in humoristic picture stories was the appropriation of medieval and Gothic styles. The interest in imitating medieval illustration led to a tradition of diagramming that would eventually become speech bubbles, emanata, and motion lines. The interest in imitating Gothic illustration first led to stories similar to German fairy tales, before those gave way to simple stories in which mischievous and cute (read: large-eyed) children played practical jokes on adults.
  </p>
  <p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    By the late 1800s, the beginnings of cinematography were having a significant impact on the composition of comics. Eadweard Muybridge’s photographic plates inspired artists such as A. B. Frost to illustrate comics with detailed studies of subjects moving against identical backgrounds. Frost’s stories were initially relatively complex; his first series of comics depicted an elderly painter opposed to the influence of photography and the realism it was bringing to the arts, satirizing one side of the debate between symbol and representation. Once Frost began to make comics for newspapers, in the 18880s, his stories became simpler. By the mid-1890s, the imitation of Muybridge’s plates became a standard technique for many newspaper comics. (Fig. 4.)

    <p class=" blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
      Some artists mourned the loss of compositional creativity that came with this development, and worried about the fate of the medium. This worry would not lead to any significant changes for another decade, though. In the meantime, artists would bring dialogue to their increasingly simplistic stories.
  </p>
  <p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    Speech balloons originated as phylacteries in medieval manuscripts. Phylacteries were illustrated scrolls attached to characters that functioned as labels so that viewers could keep all the different angels in an image straight. This was initially a use they retained in caricatures. For the larger part of the 1800s, though, the word balloons had a bizarre in-between role. They still functioned as labels for characters, but the labels were written in the first-person voice of the artist. For example, an anonymous cartoonist in 1810 labeled one of their characters with the words “You've Got your Greys yet I see! I thought you wanted to get rid of them.” (These labels were used most commonly in cartoons with a single panel. They did not not, until they became used as indications of dialogue voiced by the characters, appear in the structure of comic strips used by Töpffer or later artists inspired by Muybridge. This was because the labels were used for the detective work aspect of the Hogarth-like single panel cartoons, and were out of place in the context of stories where each panel represented a moment in a sequence.) The first time word balloons were used as speech balloons indicating dialogue spoken by characters was a one-off joke, in an 1896 comic by Richard Outcalt. It makes little sense from the perspective of the present day, where word balloons always indicate dialogue. Smolderen spent several pages explaining the joke; I do not understand it; it involves a parrot, a phonograph, and a kid in a yellow costume with some sort of dialogue written on it. Eventually, what started as a joke became a standard technique; by 1900 cartoonists were frequently using word balloons to indicate dialogue spoken by characters. (Fig. 5.)
</p>
<p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  By this point, comics very nearly resembled what they do today, except for stylistic differences in art and lettering. Smolderen, though, sees fit to conclude his history of comics with a chapter on Winsor McCay. McCay created two series of comic strips before beginning his work as an animator. The first of these was <i>Little Sammy Sneeze</i>. In every single episode, characters engaged in a leisurely activity are interrupted by Little Sammy’s sneeze. It parodied the absurdly repetitive structure of other comics, where the story never changed, the composition of the panels never changed, and there was always a dramatic event that occurred between the fourth and fifth panels.</p>

  <p class=" blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    (The choice of a sneeze was deliberate. It referenced a well-known <i>Harper’s</i> article that featured many successive images of a man sneezing, and described the sneeze as an involuntary and inevitable reflexive action. By referencing the sneeze, McCay described the plot of standard comics as involuntary, inevitable, and reflexive.) The second of McCay’s series of comics was <i>Little Nemo in Slumberland</i>. While <i>Little Sammy</i> parodied the repetitive nature of comics, <i>Little Nemo</i> proposed a viable alternative. Inspired by dreams, <i>Little Nemo</i> featured composition, stories, characters, worlds, and laws of physics that changed from episode to episode. (Fig. 6.) <i>Little Nemo</i> very nearly resembled modern-day comics, only differing from them in its style of lettering and the way in which it was printed.

  <h3 class="green2">III. Contemporary Uses and Artists</h3>
  <p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
    	Between the early 1900s and the present day, many new types of comics appeared, and existing ones evolved further. For many decades, comics were associated solely with stories of superheroes. While gag cartoons and superhero comics still exist, they have become more complex, especially in their styles of illustration. (For example, superhero comics have strayed from the exaggerated style popularized by Jack Kirby.) Today, alongside newspaper comic strips and periodical comic books, there are graphic novels, self-published “underground comix”, webcomics, and other varieties of comics. The new varieties have expanded the types of stories that comics tell. The most well-known example of this is <i>Maus</i>, by Art Spiegelman. It tells both the story of Spiegelman’s father’s experience in WWII and the story of Spiegelman’s experience interviewing his father, and it opened the door for many more serious stories in the form of comics. <i>Outside the Box</i>, a collection of Hillary Chute’s interviews with contemporary cartoonists, includes several examples of serious stories being told in graphic novels: Joe Sacco’s <i>Footnotes in Gaza</i>, for instance, examines violent incidents during the Suez crisis. Alison Bechdel’s <i>Fun Home</i> examines the life and suicide of the author’s closeted gay father. Graphic novels have also provided an outlet for experimentation with illustration and prose, seen in graphic novels such as Chris Ware’s <i>Building Stories</i>, in which a building narrates the lives of its inhabitants in a colorful and precisely illustrated world with complex architecture and stylized circular humans.
