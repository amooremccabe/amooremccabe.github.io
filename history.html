<h3 class="green2">I. Introduction</h3><p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
	  Perhaps the greatest advantage of the form of comics is that it makes stories interesting to look at. The art of storytelling is difficult, but its objective can be described simply as keeping readers reading. Many stories have already been told in one form or another, and authors must often change the way in which they tell the stories instead of the stories themselves. (This is not to imply that the stories themselves do not have significant differences from one another. At least in my experience, though, the way in which the story is told is what gets remembered.) Adding pictures to the stories offers a wealth of new methods of storytelling. Many successful works of comics follow this form. In <i>Maus</i>, Art Spiegelman told his father’s story of the Holocaust, while illustrating characters as mice. In <i>Building Stories</i>, Chris Ware told stories of loneliness from the figurative and literal point of view of a building. This paper will examine the history of the form of comics as its techniques of visual storytelling became increasingly sophisticated, describe contemporary examples of the medium, and consider works that analyze the medium of comics or offer instructions for success in it in order to inform my own approach to visual storytelling.

<h3 class="green2">II. History</h3><p class="indent blue3" style="line-height: 2;">
  My source of information for the early history of comics is <i>The Origins of Comics</i>, by Thierry Smolderen. It traces the history of sequential art from the early 1700s to the early 1900s, at which point the comics being published began to bear some resemblance to those that are published today. In summary:

  While sequential art has existed approximately as long as humans have been making art, Smolderen begins to trace the history of modern comics with the work of William Hogarth. Raised in a debtor’s prison, Hogarth came to resent rules and regulation in any form. While he admired the artistic style of the Baroque movement, he resented the way in which it was taught. He abandoned the traditional method of copying the works of earlier painters, and instead walked the streets of London, looking for scenes and figures that he could illustrate later from memory. Later in his career, Hogarth became interested in telling stories. Inspired by Venetian picture stories, which traditionally told the stories of mythological or religious heroes, Hogarth made collections of engravings depicting the stories of less respected members of society: A Harlot’s Progress was published in 1732, A Rake’s Progress in 1735. These works, for their era, were unusually sympathetic to the characters they represented. For example, the first plate of A Harlot’s Progress (Fig. 1), references The Choice of Hercules, a common allegorical motif at the time. In the myth, Hercules was confronted by personifications of Virtue and Vice. In the first panel of A Harlot’s Progress, the religious man (a personification of Virtue) has already turned his back on the woman who is the central character of the story. As put by Smolderen, “if Virtue doesn’t even speak to her, what chance does she have to take the proper path?” (Smolderen 22). These examples of sequential art are important to the history of comics in two ways. First, they represented the chaos of life on the streets with Baroque realism, an early instance of the comic art tradition of using either a style of art that contrasts with the content being represented or multiple contrasting styles of art in one image. Second, it brought some of the complexity of the written word to a visual context; the engravings required deliberate detective work for the meanings of the stories to emerge.
