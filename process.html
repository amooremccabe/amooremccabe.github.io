<p class="green2">how to make a page of comics, if for some reason you want to seem like you don't really know how to make a page of comics.
  <br><br><br>
1. Outline events and dialog
  This step can be scary. It is helpful to scribble madly, knowing that no one on the planet will see this stage of your creative process.
2. Sketch out panels
  It is best to draw the panels all on one big page. If you draw one panel on each small page, then you can't see what the composition looks like, and you have to figure it out as you draw the final page.
3. Draw the final composition on the final paper, in colored pencil
  And also ink it. Technically that's another step, but I forgot to take two separate photos.
4. Scan the page, get rid of the colored pencil
  In GIMP, at least, you do this with an effect called "threshold."
  This one can dramatically alter the appearance of the page. If you want to know what the page will look like after this step while you're on the previous step, you can just take a selfie with your half-finished piece and run the threshold on that.
  Tip: This is how they make the advertisements for rockstars.
5. Color things.
  It helps to have a color scheme, and stick with it. But if you forgot to include the color red, and you're halfway through the project, it's never too late to add red.
